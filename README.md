## 🚀 About Me

“You can find me somewhere between circuit diagrams and Java classes, probably debugging both. I chose ECE because I couldn't decide between building systems and breaking algorithms — so I do both.”

Vanakkam, I’m a third-year Electronics and Communication Engineering student at Saveetha Engineering College with a strong interest in both core electronics and computer science. I’m passionate about learning how technology can solve real-world problems, especially in areas like AI, Machine Learning, Embedded Systems, and Software Development.

Driven by curiosity and a hands-on mindset, I’m constantly exploring new concepts and sharpening my skills in areas like Java, Python, and system-level thinking. I enjoy taking on challenges that push me to grow both technically and personally.

Open to opportunities that help me learn, contribute, and innovate.
